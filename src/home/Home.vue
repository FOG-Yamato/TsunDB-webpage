        How do I submit data to the tsundere-database?
    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">
        Currently, the only (legitimate) way of sending data to our database is by enabling it in KC3.
        You can go to your KC3æ”¹ Settings and enable the option of sending data to the tsunderes. You will help us greatly by doing this. Make sure that you keep your KC3 updated though, as our database rejects submissions from older versions. 
        Also, no, I will not be selling your data, I promise. =3=<br />
